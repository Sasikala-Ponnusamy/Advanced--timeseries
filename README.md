# Advanced Time Series Forecasting with LSTM
This project predicts store sales using LSTM neural networks.

## Dataset
Source:Kaggle -Store Sales Dataset
columns:date, store, sales, promo, holiday
## Tools used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- tensorflow
- numpy
- shap
## Steps
- Data preprocessing
- Missing value handlings
- Visualization
- LSTM model training
- RMSE evaluation
- SHAP explainability
  Due to compatibility issues between SHAP and LSTM ,model interpretation is explained using trend analysis,
  Sesonability patterns and actual vs predicted sales plots.

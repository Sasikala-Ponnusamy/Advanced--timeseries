🔹 Advanced Time Series Forecasting with LSTM – Implementation Details
This project implements an end-to-end time series forecasting pipeline using an LSTM neural network, following production-ready engineering practices and interpretability requirements.
# Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Store Sales Dataset
Columns used:
date – temporal index
sales – target variable
The dataset is chronologically sorted to preserve temporal dependencies.
## Data Preprocessing
Missing values are handled using forward fill (FFILL) to maintain sales continuity.
Sales values are scaled using MinMaxScaler to stabilize LSTM training.
A sliding window approach (30 days) is used to convert the time series into a supervised learning format.
### Model Architecture
Model: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
Input: Previous 30 days of sales
Hidden units: Tuned between 32 and 64
Output: Next-day sales prediction
Optimizer: Adam
Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
### Hyperparameter Tuning
A formal hyperparameter sweep is conducted to improve robustness:
LSTM units: 32, 64
Epochs: 20, 50
The best configuration is selected based on minimum training loss.
###3 Evaluation Metrics
Two evaluation metrics are used:
RMSE – Measures overall prediction error magnitude
MAPE – Provides domain-specific interpretability for retail forecasting
Using both metrics ensures technical accuracy and business relevance.
####Model Explainability (SHAP)
To address the black-box nature of LSTM models, SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) is integrated:
SHAP DeepExplainer is applied on the trained LSTM model
Feature importance is visualized using SHAP summary plots
Results indicate that recent historical sales values have the highest impact on predictions
This satisfies the explainability requirement specified in the project prompt.
###Model Evaluation and Visualization
the trained LSTM model predictions are compared with actual sales values.
A line plot is used to visualize model performance over time.
-Blue line:Actual sales
-Orange line:Predicted sales
the helps in visually assessing the forecasting accuracy.
### Code Structure & Production Readiness
The project is implemented using a modular structure:
Data loading
Preprocessing
Model construction
Training
Evaluation
Explainability
This separation of concerns improves readability, maintainability, and scalability.

## Limitations
Analysis limited to a single store
Univariate forecasting without external features
Hyperparameter tuning limited to a small search space
### Future Enhancements
Incorporation of external variables (holidays, promotions)
Multivariate and multi-store forecasting
Advanced tuning using Keras Tuner
Deployment as a REST API
